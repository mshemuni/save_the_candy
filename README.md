# Save The Candy

Save the candy from ANTs.

You have one or more candies. Ants want to eat them.

Your job is to preevent it by eliminating Ants by clicking on them.

Each ant has stamina. Thus to eliminate an ant you might need to hit them multiple times.

If an ant take a bite from the candy, it will gain stamina.

If you are in trouble, right click to eliminate ants in a small area. This is a limited weapon and has a cooldown.
